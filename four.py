#To define immutability in my own words, I would say that immutability refers to the inability to change the
# state or value of an object. In the context of Python, an immutable object is an object whose state or value
# cannot be modified after it is created. Examples of immutable objects in Python include strings, numbers, and tuples.
# In contrast, mutable objects are objects whose state or value can be modified after they are created. Examples 
# of mutable objects in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.
